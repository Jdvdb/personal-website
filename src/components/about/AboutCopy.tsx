        My identity as a developer is as certain as a dice roll. I was pulled
        into coding because it seemed like a limitless tool that could somehow
        do anything. Iâ€™ve jumped around app and web development, machine
        learning, and data science to see what computers are capable of. There
        is so much to learn about in all of these fields so I'm taking my time
        to continue learning about each and decide what I want to do as a
        career.

        When I'm not developing, you'll usually see new activities being
        uploaded to my Strava account. The most common activities are running
        and cycling because I love seeing how far I can push myself to get a new
        personal record. However, you'll occasionally see activities for
        volleyball, swimming, snowboarding, and wake surfing! Most of my
        remaining free time is spent learning and playing too many games of
        chess. My favourite openings at the moment are the Vienna and Caro Kann!
